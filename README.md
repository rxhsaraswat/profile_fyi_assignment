The project needs its api to be hosted, which is why no products would be visible right now :(

Unfortunately, i tried to host the api but couldnt do it last minute! Will still see if i can do as soon as possible

the api is taken from here: https://github.com/dvishal485/flipkart-scraper-api


I will upload a loom recording though, so that you can see this at your convinence https://www.loom.com/share/810611c4387e43aba3b90741f22b7f70?sid=8b695e84-e246-4737-a12a-5f0a040a7cda
